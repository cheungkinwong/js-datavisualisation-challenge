# Javascript Challenge : "Data Visualisation"

by Cheung Kin Wong

## Objectives

This consolidation challenge will help you assess your ability to solve a problem inspired from real-life situations using your new javascript muscles involving the following know-hows :

-    **DOM** manipulation
-    **AJAX** request
-    Using **Third-party libraries**
-    **problem-solving** : design a logical solution to implement the expected result
-    Debugging using the console
-    Understand the notion of **"separation of concerns"**

### Constraints

-    You can't edit the html file.
-    You have the choice of the type of graphics. Considers the most relevant based on the data and what story they can "tell".
-    The choice of the javascript library is limited to the 2 libraries offered (there are many others, but these are references and are very popular)

## Evaluation

The evaluation method chosen is a **self-evaluation** based on the following indicators:

#### 1. handling of the DOM:

-    [x] I was able to find the right selector to do it.
-    [x] I was able to inject the graph in the right place on the page via javascript.
-    [x] I was able to retrieve the html data in a format adapted to my javascript code.

### 2. Request ajax:

-    [x] I was able to receive the answer from the remote server in json.
-    [x] Then, I was able to build a callback function to process this data.

### 3. Use of **third party libraries**:

-    [x] I was able to integrate the third-party library into my application.
-    [x] I used the documentation provided by the library.
-    [x] I was able to generate the 2 inline data graphs.
-    [x] I was able to generate the "remote data" graph.

### 4. Problem-solving:

-    [x] Syntactic rigor: I was able to translate the processes I imagined into javascript syntax.
-    [x] Logical thinking: Through iterations and trial and error, I was able to find a logical path that works to address the issues raised by the client's request. Specifically:
     -    [x] I was able to generate the 2 inline data graphs. - [x] I was able to generate the "remote data" graph.
     -    [x] I was able to build a callback function to process remote data (received via ajax). - [x] I was able to make the realtime graph refresh in real time. - [x] I was able to display the detailed data when I hover the mouse.

### 5. Debugging:

-    [x] I use the console to understand what is happening and compare what I am trying to program with what the machine is doing.

### 6. Separation of concerns:

-    [x] If I disable javascript, the user experience is satisfactory, the user has access to data and content
-    [x] If I enable javascript, the tables are enhanced with an interactive graph.
